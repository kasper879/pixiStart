# pixiStart
My first PIXI app, with a bouncing ball. 

###To run the Application:  
    1. Clone the project 
    2. Go to the project 
    3. npm install 
    4. Server is running on a localhost:3000

## How the application works 
Apllication runs index.html, which has a reference to app.js and a stylesheets. 
app.js is based on PIXI.js. 
Inside app.js, comments can be found for each functionality.
